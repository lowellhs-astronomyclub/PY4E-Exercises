Hey everyone!

If you're reading this, you've found Lowell Astronomy Club's PY4E Exercises GitHub repository succesfully! 
Make sure you've completed the GitHub crash course before starting this. Here is where we'll be posting our solutions to the exercises in PY4E.

Open the exercise prompts for each chapter through [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lowellhs-astronomyclub/PY4E-Exercises/master), starting with [VARIABLES.ipynb](https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/lowellhs-astron--py4e-exercises-h8ofmkpd/notebooks/VARIABLES.ipynb). Once you've finished with the exercises for one chapter, click "Download". Next, create a new branch from "master" and title it "Initials-FinishedExercises" (see "EY-FinishedExercises" for an example) and upload your notebook to that branch. As you complete the exercises for the next chapters, upload them to that same branch.

Note that not all exercises for each chapter are here. You only need to do the ones that are. All of the exercises are from Severance's [Python For Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/html3/).

Happy coding!
